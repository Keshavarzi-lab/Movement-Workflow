-	 **2025-07-18T09-22-12 :** 5 trials with the circular visual landmark whose position is set relative to the rewarded nose-poke, random rotations of nose-pokes, inner and outer rings, random position of the target zone, random nose-poke rewarded, reward tone, no mismatch, LED indicator on the nose-poke only for the first trial.

-	**2025-07-18T16-19-29 :** 10 trials of learn_poke with no rotations, all nose-pokes rewarded, reward always available, fixed circular landmark, trigger zone the size of the entire arena, no reward tone, no mismatch.

- **2025-07-18T16-36-29 :** 6 trials corresponding to the different steps of task learning, 1st no rotation, target zone is the entire arena, no reward tone and unlimited time to go to target zone, 2nd is similar but delay before target zone is available (from 5 to 20s) and sound ON when the zone is triggered, 3rd target zone is smaller with its center is set at randomised position, small rotations of the 3 rings (from -90 to +90), landmark is fixed at an absolute position, 4th trigger zone decrease again, rotation range increase (from -100 to +100), reward timeout decrease, 5th reward timeout decrease again and rewarded nose-pokes decrease, 6th reward timeout = 5s, and only one nose-poke rewarded

- **2025-07-18T17-13-43 :** each trial different to test everything, 1st has randomized rotations, 2nd is similar but the rewarded nose-poke is at a fixed position, 3rd has a mismatch, 4th is grating, 5th is firefly, 6th is firefly + landmark, 7th is grating + landmark
